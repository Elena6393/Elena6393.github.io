These sections analyze the deep integration of agriculture, culture, and tourism in Xiaotang Township from three aspects: "culture + tourism," "agriculture + tourism," and "art + tourism" respectively. West Pond demonstrates ethnic shared prosperity where government, enterprises, universities, and new ethnic minority farmers innovate together creating new rural tourism business models; Middle Aol showcases spiritual shared prosperity by cultivating local cultural symbols and integrating art education into the construction of spiritual civilization; Huangbu enriches the local culture, continuing the rural cultural lineage, allowing the co-development of intangible cultural heritage preservation and ancient village tourism.

The work "Chasing Dreams in Xiaotang" was shot over 17 days, accumulating a total of 420GB of material, and the finished film is 7 minutes long. Techniques such as aerial photography, time-lapse, and frame ramping were employed, with meticulous color grading applied to all footage. The path to shared prosperity in Xiaotang Township is characterized by the development of an integrated agricultural, cultural, and tourism economy. To elucidate this practical experience, we selected three distinctive villages for research and filming, aiming to establish exemplars and abstract Xiaotang Township's collective wisdom on a micro scale. The content is ultimately presented in three parts: "Drunken on Grapes" at West Pond, "Poetic Paintings" at Middle Aol, and "Ancient Charm" at Huangbu Village. These sections analyze the deep integration of agriculture, culture, and tourism in Xiaotang Township from three aspects: "culture + tourism," "agriculture + tourism," and "art + tourism" respectively. West Pond demonstrates ethnic shared prosperity where government, enterprises, universities, and new ethnic minority farmers innovate together creating new rural tourism business models; Middle Aol showcases spiritual shared prosperity by cultivating local cultural symbols and integrating art education into the construction of spiritual civilization; Huangbu enriches the local culture, continuing the rural cultural lineage, allowing the co-development of intangible cultural heritage preservation and ancient village tourism.

**Review** <br>
Looking back on my interned work, I found the trend of mediatization of politics, that the media serves the political objectives via various cultural forms and many political practices rely on the media’s power.  Whether in a commercial advertisement or political communication campaign, the creators' intentions are to consciously "seek channels of communication" through the media, to "aspire to consensus" or "create
consent" in the arena of a commercialized society.<br>
When I was filming _Chasing Dreams in Xiaotang_ for Ningbo government agency, a documentary of rural
revitalization in Xiaotang village, I explored that the Perspective of First-person Narrative is the best method
to arise political identification.  The protagonist's autonomous narrative of China's rural development policies
can better evoked the audience's empathy for the farmers' desire for a better life, while the aerial images of
the beautiful countryside and the lively cultural landscape tell people about the happiness of life in the new
reformed countryside.  Thus the film creates a supportive attitude among viewers as they learn about the
policies targeting rural reform.  Media agenda setting, reporting frames, discourse forms and narrative styles
may all have a shaping effect on politics.  Therefore, I believe it is important to learn about constructing media<br>
agendas, framing communication, image management, and shaping political branding or PR strategies.
In completing my public opinion practical project, I learned that social media and alternative media have
great power on social mobilization, for they can aggregate and differentiate groups by mending weak ties
and connective action.  It is competent in shaping political attitudes, influencing political agendas and public
decisions.  It is undeniable that new media has also brought new challenges to social and global governance,
such as fake news with echo chamber effect, and the Internet Group Crisis Event.  Perhaps the changes in
human communication patterns caused by modern media technology trigger these crises.  However it has
also given us the impetus and direction to make progress in our work of social mobilization and public opinion
guidance.<br></p>
