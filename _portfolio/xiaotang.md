**Introduction:** <br>
The work "Chasing Dreams in Xiaotang" was shot over 17 days, accumulating a total of 420GB of material, and the finished film is 7 minutes long. Techniques such as aerial photography, time-lapse, and frame ramping were employed, with meticulous color grading applied to all footage. The path to shared prosperity in Xiaotang Township is characterized by the development of an integrated agricultural, cultural, and tourism economy. To elucidate this practical experience, we selected three distinctive villages for research and filming, aiming to establish exemplars and abstract Xiaotang Township's collective wisdom on a micro scale. The content is ultimately presented in three parts: "Drunken on Grapes" at West Pond, "Poetic Paintings" at Middle Aol, and "Ancient Charm" at Huangbu Village. These sections analyze the deep integration of agriculture, culture, and tourism in Xiaotang Township from three aspects: "culture + tourism," "agriculture + tourism," and "art + tourism" respectively. West Pond demonstrates ethnic shared prosperity where government, enterprises, universities, and new ethnic minority farmers innovate together creating new rural tourism business models; Middle Aol showcases spiritual shared prosperity by cultivating local cultural symbols and integrating art education into the construction of spiritual civilization; Huangbu enriches the local culture, continuing the rural cultural lineage, allowing the co-development of intangible cultural heritage preservation and ancient village tourism. A highlight of this film is its functional prominence. While celebrating the shared prosperity efforts of the working people, it also summarizes unique local experiences of shared prosperity, which is where the value of this film lies. As a record of rural revitalization, it not only showcases the new faces of farmers and rural areas, providing visual enjoyment to the audience; it also serves as a professionally esteemed and academically valuable case study, facilitating learning and emulation by other rural areas.
