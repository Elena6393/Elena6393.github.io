**Abstract:** The concept of news games has been proposed for some time. However, with recent developments in mass media technologies and facilities, there is increasing attention on the concept of news games as a novel way of presenting news. At the same time, research into news games has also undergone many changes and developments. This article analyzes the interactive relationships between news games and their users from the perspective of news communication and related literature. The main goal is to identify the application values of news games in the field of transcultural communication, particularly the element of high user interaction levels. A review of related literature indicates that the interactive relationships between news games and its users can be characterized by programming rhetoric, non-linear narratives, immersive experiences, soft communication through symbols to achieve emotional resonance, and so on. News games can provide a virtual space that tolerates various cultural elements, engage users from different cultural clusters to go beyond cultural barriers, as well as discuss and strengthen their understanding of news events.
