excerpt: 'This meta-analysis examines the persuasive effects of gain-loss framing and evidence type (narrative and non-narrative), and their interactions, to identify the most effective communication strategies. The findings reveal that neither gain nor loss frames consistently outperform the other, and narrative evidence generally has a stronger impact on persuasion than non-narrative. Importantly, the combination of a gain frame with non-narrative evidence emerged as particularly effective, enhancing both behavioral intentions and attitudes. However, loss-framed narratives were found to be most engaging in terms of information processing. Moderating variables were explored, with sample type showing marginal significance; gain frames performed better in convenience samples. '

# Abstract
This meta-analysis examines the persuasive effects of gain-loss framing and evidence type (narrative and non-narrative), and their interactions, to identify the most effective communication strategies. The findings reveal that neither gain nor loss frames consistently outperform the other, and narrative evidence generally has a stronger impact on persuasion than non-narrative. Importantly, the combination of a gain frame with non-narrative evidence emerged as particularly effective, enhancing both behavioral intentions and attitudes. However, loss-framed narratives were found to be most engaging in terms of information processing. Moderating variables were explored, with sample type showing marginal significance; gain frames performed better in convenience samples.
